<p>I feel it is obvious for you get the MacBook Air. I noticed many people are "going pro", but it has too many features you won't use. It has a great video card for amazing-looking video games that you will play <b>never</b>. It has a super-fast processor for extensive quick calculations used in either (once again) video games that you will play <b>never</b>, or calculating 5,000,000 (five million) numbers at once on a giant spreadsheet like mom does, which you do <b>never</b>. It has the extensive RAM for multitasking with 1,000,000,000 (one billion) windows up at once, which is too stressful for your leisure time, and you will do <b>never</b>.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air, however, is perfect. All you ever really do is surf the web. The solid state makes it boot in two seconds (almost literally), so the waiting frustration is gone. Safari, Firefox, Chrome, whatever browser you use will load on approximately one millisecond. Some say it sucks because of it's lack of a disk drive. Honestly, do you remember the last time you used that on your current old & crappy leisure computer? If you do, it was propably installing software. In case this rare problem arises, put the disk in any other computer & connect wirelessly. The last time you do this will probably be after the month you bought the computer. After the initial installing of software, you rarely ever use the drive again. Not enough storage?!? 256 GB is a <b>lot</b>. The whole freaking operating system only takes 2GB! You can install Mac OS X Lion <b>128 freaking times</b>! Some have said the processor isn't that good. Thay are <b>wrong</b>. You can get a intel i7 in there! Not enough ram? What, are you going to open two windows at once? About 2MB is enough for that. You have (by default) 2GB. You can upgrade that to 4GB.</p>

<p>Now, I hope we are all in agreement that the Air is the better option. Now the question is: Which one? I made a chart of the options relevant to you:</p>

<table width=100% border=1>
	<tr>
		<td width=16%>Screen size</td>
		<td colspan=2><h3>11-Inch</h3></td>
		<td colspan=2><h3>13-Inch</h3></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Max screen resolution</td>
		<td colspan=2>1366 X 768</td>
		<td colspan=2>1440 X 900</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Disk space</td>
		<td width=21%>64</td>
		<td width=21%>128 or 256</td>
		<td width=21%>128</td>
		<td width=21%>256</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Web surfing time on battery</td>
		<td colspan=2>Up to 5 hours</td>
		<td colspan=2>Up to 7 hours</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Price</td>
		<td>$999</td>
		<td>$1,199 OR $1,499 (with 256GB storage)</td>
		<td>$1,299</td>
		<td>$1,599</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>I think you may want to get the lower 13-inch for the extra battery, but you don't have as much storage as you wanted. I don't think this will make a lot of a difference, but if you really want it, you could get the upper 13-inch. The upper 11-inch is good too for the storage, sacraficing battery life, but more cost effective. I hope this helps!</p>
